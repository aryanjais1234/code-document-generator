# 📄 Code Document Generator

## 🚩 Problem Statement

Maintaining high-quality documentation for software projects is a constant challenge. Developers often spend excessive time updating docs, and outdated documentation can slow onboarding, reduce productivity, and cause frustration. There’s a need for a tool that automatically generates accurate, readable, and up-to-date documentation directly from your code!
